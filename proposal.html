    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>What is it about</h3>
    <p>
    This website is about my personal learning experience in data analyst. It will
      introduce what skills you need to learn in order to be a data analyst. I will
      introduce the three main packages in python for data analyst, which are numpy, 
      pandas, and Matplotlib. Besides, it also include the reflection and code of my 
      previous data analyst project.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the objective of my website</h3>
    <p>
    This website is used for sharing my personal experience since I was very confused 
      when I frst start self learn those skills. By sharing those experiences and 
      teach to my audience, it not only help me further understand the model I used 
      in my project, but also help others who is interested in data analyst.    
    </p>

    <h3>Who is your target audience</h3>
    <p>
    My audiences are people who are interested in data analyst. Since data analyst 
      can be applied in multiple industries, I believe this is where the future is. 
    </p>

    <h3>What contents will each page include</h3>
    <p>
    I think there should be at least 4 pages, which are pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, 
    and one project. For first three pages, the page should include the what it is, 
    how to install, and some common function in those packages. For the project, the 
    page should include what is it about, the code of the project, and the analyst of the result.
